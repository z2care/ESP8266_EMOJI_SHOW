/*
 * I²S data output clock (bit clock) calculation:
 * According to http://bbs.espressif.com/viewtopic.php?t=958 and some own tests
 * From my assumptions the I²S bit frequency is calculated as follows:
 * 160MHz is the internal clock speed (independent of CPU frequency and crystal)
 * bitfreq = 2 * 160MHz / I2S_BCK_DIV / I2S_CLKM_DIV 
 * For I2S_BCK_DIV = 21 and WS_I2S_CLKM = 21:
 * bitfreq = 3.8 MHz which means each output bit takes 0.2625us
 * I should propably test this formula with an oscilloscope...
 * This timing works fine for WS2811 in fast mode, adapt for WS2812B / WS2811 in slow mode
 *
 * Use 24 bytes (must be divisible by 4, makes 24 / 4 = 6 uint32_t's in tape) at the end
 * of the "tape" to generate the ~50us break, adds up to: 24 * 8 * 0.2625us = 50.4us
